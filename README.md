### Thesis Consultation Package - FAQs

1. **How much is your title consultation package?**  
   The package has a one-time service fee of 1000 pesos. This allows you to focus on other academic tasks without worrying about your research title.

2. **What if the title you provided doesn't get approved?**  
   The service fee is a one-time payment. I will be your consultant until your research title gets approved, with no additional charges.

3. **Do you provide a research proposal paper?**  
   I provide a standard research title summary, including the proposed title, a brief discussion, and objectives. For a full research proposal paper, you can avail of my thesis proposal writing package, priced according to your school's format.

   Payment is via GCash only. Please send a screenshot of the transaction receipt through my personal Messenger account. Payment is required before the consultation meeting.

5. **What is the assurance that you are not a scammer?**  
   This is my primary source of income. You can verify my identity through my Facebook profile (reels, highlights, photos).

Feel free to publicly post on social media if I fail to provide the services mentioned. Ensure you have enough evidence, such as GCash receipts and videos, to support your claim. False allegations will be sued for cyber libel.

6. **How long should we wait for your chat support?**  
   I check my [```Messenger```](https://m.me/jfourjavier) inbox every hour and reply immediately or within a day, especially if I'm working on a rush project. For real-time support, inform me at least a day prior. Don't overthink if you don't receive an immediate reply.
